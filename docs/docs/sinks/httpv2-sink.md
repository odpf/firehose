# HttpV2 Sink

HttpV2 Sink is implemented in Firehose using the Http sink connector implementation in Depot library. For details on all the features supported by HttpV2 Sink, please refer the Depot documentation [here](https://github.com/goto/depot/blob/main/docs/sinks/http-sink.md).

### Configuration

For HttpV2 sink in Firehose we need to set first (`SINK_TYPE`=`httpv2`). There are some generic configs which are common across different sink types which need to be set which are mentioned in [generic.md](../advance/generic.md). Http sink specific configs are mentioned in Depot repository. You can check out the Http Sink configs [here](https://github.com/goto/depot/blob/main/docs/reference/configuration/http-sink.md)
