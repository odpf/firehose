## Making a pull request

#### Incorporating upstream changes from master

Our preference is the use of git rebase instead of git merge. Signing commits

```bash
# Include -s flag to signoff
$ git commit -s -m "feat: my first commit"
```

Good practices to keep in mind

* Follow the [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format for all commit messages.
* Fill in the description based on the default template configured when you first open the PR
* Include kind label when opening the PR
* Add WIP: to PR name if more work needs to be done prior to review
* Avoid force-pushing as it makes reviewing difficult
